# Lung-Cancer-Patient-Data-Management-System
## Purpose
* Build a data management system for lung cancer patient data.
  
* Use SQL database to efficiently store and manage patient information.
  
* Provide big data technology for future large size datasets.
  
* Develop Python-based models to predict the stage of cancer.
  
* Provide insights to assist hospitals in diagnosing cancer stages.
  
* Support early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Project overview
Lung cancer is used to predict earlier diagnoses and treatment planning that can help doctors discover the disease before becoming worth. The project contain the following:

- Docker-compose file to launch the system and install all requirments needed.
- Batch processing using spark with juypter notebook to visualize the results.
- ELT processing with SSIS to transform data and keep chance for other stages to modify on transformation.
- predctive model* with python to benefit from the data and get project purpose.
- Power Bi to visualize data to stackholders with easy simplification.
  
## Architecture
- SQL server to extract data in staging layer for future use and creating data warehouse.
- Juypter notebook to analyze data with python using Matplotlib and Make predictions with machine learning libraries.
- Pyspark to add big data technology and use batch processing with it.
- Power Bi to create dashboards and visualize data.
  
## Technologies used
- Docker to containerize the project with eazy deploymnet.
- SQL server To create staging layer and data warehouse.
- SQL Alchemy to create engine and interact with database using python
- Matplotlib to analyze data and get hidden patterns.
- Machine learning libraries to make some predictions and use it with big data.
- Pyspark for batch processing and handle large datasets in the future.
- Power Bi to visualize to stakeholders and take decisions.

## Data sources
CSV file from data world website and another one created to handle some analyzing process.
